# Enigma solution
### Step 1
- A button is hidden in the top left corner of the page.
- To find it, either look at the source page (Ctrl+U on most browsers)
- Or, inspecting element, that mostly does the same thing or just click everywhere.

### Step 2
- First pic is a Big Apple
- Seocnd pic represents Freedom/Liberty
- Third pic is just some buildings
##### *This leads us to New York City*
Also known as 'The Big Apple', has the Statue of Liberty and is known for the buildings

### Step 3
- This is a chain of keys that you have to do on an old keyboard phone [like this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hHq4v.jpg)
##### *Answer : Give your blood*
- Remember that if you are old enough, this can save lives, and if you are lucky and live in the US, they even pay you for it!

### Step 4
- It is just a morse code
- -.. ..- -... -. .. ..- --
##### *Answer : Dubnium*

### Step 5
- It is simply letters in sign language.
- The message says 'Hey, the answer is Chicoutimi'
##### *So answer : Chicoutimi*

### Step 6
- The french flag is here because you need to translate 'Hello'
- So Hello is 'Bonjour' in French.
- After this, SHA256 is a crypting algorithm
- You need to encrypt 'Bonjour' with SHA256
- It gives you : 9172e8eec99f144f72eca9a568759580edadb2cfd154857f07e657569493bc44
- Since there's '2 *' before SHA256, you need to make the operation one more time.
##### *Answer : 11e9a949ab811e7357ec1a75e50d88f4445af2de3d482490b7d8d4f309f4cb48*

### Step 7
- This one start to become a little harder, it needs to be done in 2 steps.
- First you need to translate the upper part of the picture.
- This is braille and is translated veelednem
- If you write it backwards it gives you Mendeleev, the inventor of the periodic table.
- So now you need to take the symbol of the element that have for atomic number the ones in the bottom part of the picture.
- We don't do anything with the 'A', it gives us 'A Mg I Ne'
- As Mendeleev was written backwards, we have to reverse 'Amgine'
##### *Answer : Enigma*

### Step 8
- First, you have to find who's the guy in the picture.
- He's Alan turing, the man who cracked the Enigma machine during WWII
- Now, you need to take a look at the properties of the image.
- If you download it and inspects the details, you see some informations :
  - Enigma M3
  - Reflector C
  - Rot 1 --> I; Pos --> E; Ring --> G
  - Rot 2 --> II; Pos --> N; Ring --> M
  - Rot 3 --> III; Pos --> I; Ring --> A
  - plugboard --> en ig ma
- Now that we have all we need, with the name of the file 'FUUKK'
- You can decode it easily with this website : [Cryptiii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine)
##### *Answer : Dream*

### Step 9
- For this one, if we look at the picture very closely, we notice something.
- Especially in the center, there are some lines with a very slightly different color
- This is a barcode. You need to change the background color with an image editing software
- You can easily do this with paint, photoshop and even some tools online but it is a bit more complicated.
- As you reveal the barcode, we also see the logo of Twitter.
- The barcode gives a number which is 60335022.
- By combining this number with the @enigma that we see in the picture.
- It gives the link [twitter.com/enigma60335022](https://twitter.com/enigma60335022)

- On this profile, there are 2 informations :
    The post with the text : 4xfiaaOXhUUNOdgYXkrwpd?si=iXyvYk1wQqGxLq9Wf1wVCw
- The bio that says : 'I love listening to music'

- So you need to find a spotify playlist.
- Here's the link : https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4xfiaaOXhUUNOdgYXkrwpd
- The part after the '?' is optional.
- The playlist says 'Bravo, Tu As Trouvé, The Answer, Lunaire'
- A messy message but basically says 'Congratulations, you found the answer Lunaire'
##### *Answer : Lunaire*

### Step 10
- There are 2 elements in the picture, the woman and the background.
- If you search the woman, it is Dalida.
- The background color hex code is : #76bd17, in rgb : 118, 189, 23
- I know there might be some little differences sometimes but the real one is that one.
- If you search it on google, you should find websites saying that the color name is 'Lima'
- But as there might be little differences you can use that website : [Name that color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) to find the name of the color.
- With these 2 informations, 'Dalida' and 'Lima', if you search this on google, it gives you the 'Dalida Cafe Bar' and if you look at the comments of this establishment on google.
- You can find a comment made by Enigma (if id doesn,t appear in the first results, you can use the search tool with 'Enigma')
- There's a link in the comment : prnt.sc / p58653, you just have to remove the spaces.
- It gives you : [prnt.sc/p58653](http://prnt.sc/p58653)

- 4 elements are in this image :
   - A Caesar portrait
   - A text : OTDNZXQCE
   - Other text : A --> A + (RED)
   - An orangeish background

- If you take the value of red in the background it is 219
- Caesar is here to tell you that the message is coded with caesar code / caesar cipher
- Then A --> A + (RED) means you need to make an offset of 219 which is the same as 11

##### _Answer : Discomfort_

### Step 11
- For this one, you first need to analyse the image, the name of the file is 'ti_amo__meta'
- First you need to focus on the 'meta' part. There are some metadata properties hidden in the file.
- I use this website to see the metadata : [Metadata viewer](http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi)
- The property we are searching is 'Comment (pos)' that has the value '37.564025, 127.007274'
- These are gps coordinates that leads you in the middle of Seoul, South Korea.
- Link : [Google maps](http://www.google.fr/maps/place/37°33'50.5"N+127°00'26.2"E)
- You need to go to street view on the exact point of the coordinates
- You'll be able to see the café Ti amo
- However, you're not able to find the answer.
- An other property of the picture is the creation time / date when the picture was taken.
- The dates is 2009 10 26, so you need to go back in time with street view in 2009. (The only other date possible)
- After doing this, you'll be able to see the 2 Syllables '임' and '대' that are on the answer textfield.
- Between them, you can see some numbers, this is the answer.
##### _Answer : 0192840721_

### Step 12
- You need to find who's the guy in the image.
- He's Eugene Roshal, the creator of the RAR compressing format, WinRAR and FAR.
- With this information, you need to open the image with either WinRAR, 7Zip and maybe others compressing softwares also work.
- You'll find a text file inside, the file is named spectral and contains a youtube link.
- Here is the link : [Youtube](https://youtu.be/0hoGPZPVzqM)
- The video is a 5 seconds stopwatch with a glitchy effect and a weird audio.
- You only need to focus on the audio.
- You need to trace the spectral waves of the audio.
- You can either open it with audacity or do it with some online tools.
- The spectral waves will write 'CACAHUETTE'
- This is the final answer. It means peanut.
##### _Final answer : Cacahuette_
